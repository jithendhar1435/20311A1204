The task in question1 folder involves developing an HTTP microservice that retrieves JSON data from a list of URLs, merges the 'numbers' arrays from each response, removes duplicates, sorts the resulting array in ascending order, and returns it as a response

install npm
run server.js(name)//node app.js
The server should now be running at http://localhost:8008


test:http://localhost:8008/numbers?url=http://104.211.219.98/numbers/primes&url=http://104.211.219.98/numbers/fibo&url=http://104.211.219.98/numbers/odd
